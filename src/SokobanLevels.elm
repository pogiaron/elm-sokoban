The second way, which is more interesting and difficult, and the way it was designed to be played, is treating it as eight levels in one. Each letter of SOKOBAN! must be completed before the next is started, using only the balls arranged below each letter in the shape of that letter. These can be put into the letter goals in any order. While doing any letter all the other balls must be considered locked, becoming walls. After any letter is finished, the balls used for that letter become locked and the ones in the following letter become unlocked. Your target is 635 moves (or better!). Instead of doing Level 2 this way as one big level, you can do it as eight separate levels using levels 3 - 10 to progress automatically. In these the locked balls are walls and the goals for other letters are floor. This looks a bit peculiar, but the playability is correct. Note that the start position for the man for each letter is the end position for one way of doing the previous letter. You might have done it a different way.... When you've finished all eight letters, you've earned the right to do the one-push small reward level, where all the balls are shown in their goals, looking normal again. The last few levels are joke levels, mostly needing just two clicks to solve. Hey, let the program do the work!" "https://www.sourcecode.se/sokoban/levels?act=dnl_text&file=jcd.slc"

Because of the computer involvement, the start positions of the puzzles may look abstract or random. The meat of the puzzles is in the variations, the unexpected twists, and the underlying problems. The human element of design is most evident in the solved position, by construction, and I like to think of the solving process as producing order from chaos. This collection is meant for experienced solvers, or at least determined ones, as it contains probably my toughest puzzles so far. As usual I have tried to put the puzzles in rough ascending order of difficulty, but here this is even more approximate than usual as I find the puzzles difficult to compare.

A few of the puzzles feature unexpected twists within lengthy solutions and require substantial imagination, and the others I hope are at least interesting.
